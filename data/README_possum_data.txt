Metadata for possum_data.csv dataset


possum_data.csv contains data collected for the testing of five proposed drivers of geographical body-size variation in the common brushtail possum, Trichosurus vulpecula, using 588 possum skull measurements.The five proposed drivers being tested were heat conservation, heat dissipation, seasonality, productivity and the ecologically and evolutionarily relevant net primary productivity (eNPP). 



Dataset was reposited on the 23rd of March 2015 under the title "Data from: Lean-season primary productivity and heat dissipation as key drivers of geographic body-size variation in a widespread marsupial" in the DRYAD Digital Repository.

possum_data.csv contains 34 columns of data about 588 brushtail possum skull specimens.

Variable List:
Column 1: Collection- Name of Australian wildlife collection to which the brushtail possum skull belongs.
Column 2: Registration Number- Unique identifier of each specimen within the collection it came from.
Column 3: Date- Date the specimen was collection.
Column 4: CBL- Condylobasal Length (mm). Measurement of skull length. CBL was chosen as the body-size representative over total jaw length and zygomatic breadth as it does not differ between sexes.
Column 5: Latitude- Latitudinal location of the collection site of the brushtail possum skull.
Column 6: Longitude- Longitudinal location of the collection site of the brushtail possum skull.
Column 7: Island Type- Whether the collection site of the brushtail possum skull was on the Australian mainland, in Tasmania or on another smaller island. Noted in case of potential island effects.
Column 8: WinterMinTemp - Winter Minimum Temperature (degrees celsius). Average minimum temperature during winter at the the collection site of the brushtail possum skull from 1911–2009.
Column 9: AnnualMinTemp- Annual Minimum Temperature (degrees celsius). Average anunual minimum temperature at the collection site of the brushtail possum skull from 1911–2009.
Column 10: SummerWetBulbTemp - Summer Wet-Bulb Temperature (degrees celsius). Average summer wet bulb temperature at the collection site of the brushtail possum skull from 1900-2011. Wet-bulb temperature is the lowest temperature that can be reached under current ambient conditions by the evaporation of water only.
Column 11: AnnualWetBulbTemp- Annual Wet-Bulb Temperature (degrees celsius). Average annual wet-bulb temperature from the collection site of the brushtail possum skull from 1900-2011.
Column 12: SummerMaxTemp- Summer Maximum Temperature (degrees celsius). Maximum temperature during summer at the collection site of the brushtail possum skull from 1911–2009.
Column 13: AnnualMaxTemp- Annual Maximum Temperature (degrees celsius). Maximum annual temperature at the collection site of the brushtail possum skull from 1911–2009.
Column 14: AnnualRain- Annual rainfall (mm) at the collection site of the brushtail possum skull.
Column 15: P-PET- Precipitation minus Potential EvapoTranspiration (mm). A measure of climatic water balance averaged from 1911-2209 at the collection site of the brushtail possum skull.
Column 16: aaET- Areal Actual EvapoTranspiration (mm). Sum of evaporation and plant transpiration at the collection site of the brushtail possum skull.
Column 17: NDVI- Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Average measure of plant biomass and health from January 2008–March 2012 at the collection site of the brushtail possum skull that represents food availability for the possum.
Column 18: CenW- An Australian Continental NPP estimate based on fluxes of carbon/nutrients and CO2/water (gigatons of carbon per year [Gt C yr^1]) at the collection site of the brushtail possum skull from 1921-1995.
Column 19: GrowSeasRain. Growing Season Rainfall (mm). Growing season rainfall at the collection site of the brushtail possum skull. Growing season refers to the set of months with an average temperature greater than fifteen degrees Celsius. Expected to relate to peak food availability for the possums.
Column 20: GrowSeasaaET. Growing Season Areal Actual EvapoTranspiration (mm). Growing season areal actual evapotranspiration (mm) at the collection site of the brushtail possum skull.
Column 21: GrowSeasP-PET. Growing Season Precipitation minus Potential EvapoTranspiration (mm) at the collection site of the brushtail possum skull.
Column 22: GrowSeasNDVI- Growing Season Normalised Difference Vegetation Index. NDVI averaged over the plant growing season at the collection site of the brushtail possum skull. 
Column 23: CVSeasRain - Coefficient of Variation (CV) for Seasonal Rainfall at the collection site of the brushtail possum skull. The seasonal coefficient of variation (CV) for climatic and primary productivity variables is typically used as a measure of the relative deviation from mean conditions throughout the year.
Column 24: CVSeasaaET- Coefficient of Variation (CV) for Seasonal Areal Actual EvapoTranspiration at the collection site of the brushtail possum skull.
Column 25: CVSeasP-PET- Coefficient of Variation (CV) for Seasonal Precipitation minus Potential EvapoTranspiration at the collection site of the brushtail possum skull.
