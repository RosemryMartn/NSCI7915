Possum data project

Though many hypotheses have been proposed for the drivers of geographic body-size variation in mammals, a limited amount of data for species has impacted their ability to be tested. The common brushtail possum, Trichosurus vulpeca, is Australia's widest spread marsupial and provides an opportunity to test proposed drivers of geographic body-size variation through the study of museum specimens of this species. This study will assess the effect of many location-based environmental variables on possum body size as estimated using the condylobasal lengths (CBL) of 588 possum skulls.

Please see the "Impact of Environmental Variables on Body Size Variation in Trichosurus vulpecula" OSF Pre-Registration for further details.
